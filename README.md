<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This program contains 2 demonstrations from algorithms mentioned in the book Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David. In addition, there is also a third example that utilizes a real-world training set for learning.

Example 1 is a very simple learning algorithm for trashold functions from ex. 6.1 at pg.67.

Example 2 (more interesting) includes the use of halfspaces and linear programming to claasify points in a two-dimensional plane. In it, it is coded the example 9.1.1 of pg. 119 which explains how to ERM learning rule can be implemented exploiting linear programming.

The REAL WORLD EXAMPLE use classifiers and linear programming as in example 2. However, this time, the algoritm use a fashion-mnist files (that can be downloaded and unzipped in this project) as training and testing data and it displays them as well.
